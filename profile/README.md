# LocalLoop

LocalLoop is an early-stage, low-TRL concept for a federated circular economy protocol.
We publish specifications, schemas, and examples so cities, labs, and builders can explore
and shape the ecosystem.

## What exists today
- Protocol specification and schemas (draft, v0.1)
- Example payloads for interoperability
- Documentation and RFC process

## What does **not** exist yet
- Public pilots or production deployments
- Official test network
- Certified implementations

## How to get involved
- Read the protocol docs in `loop-protocol`
- Submit feedback via RFCs and issues
- Share an Expression of Interest on `https://local-loop-io.github.io`
